React is a open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta used for building User Interfaces (UI), especially single-page applications (SPA).
Its main idea: UI = f(State)
Meaning: UI updates automatically whenever the state changes.
In 2026, React has moved into a "Compiler-First" and "Server-First" era. It is no longer just a library for the browser; 
it is a full-stack architecture that allows you to run code on both the server and the client seamlessly.

1. State Hooks (The "Memory" of your app)
useState: Stores simple values (strings, booleans, objects).
useReducer: Best for complex state logic where the next state depends on the previous one.
useActionState: (Newer) Specifically for managing state during form submissions and actions.

2. Effect Hooks (The "Triggers")
useEffect: Runs code after the component renders (API calls, setting up subscriptions).
useLayoutEffect: Runs before the browser repaints the screen (useful for measuring elements).

3. Context & Ref Hooks (The "Connections")
useContext: Grabs data from a "Context Provider" so you don't have to pass props through every single level.
useRef: Holds a direct reference to a DOM element or a value that doesn't trigger a re-render.

4. Performance Hooks (Now largely automated)
useTransition: Tells React that an update is "non-urgent," keeping the UI responsive while it processes.
useDeferredValue: Defers updating a non-critical part of the UI.

JSX combined the power and expressiveness of JavaScript with the readability and accessibility of HTML
How you do something --Imperative trace the execution of program how it runs
what you do --Declarative
Many declarative APis have some sort of imperative implementation
Abstract away most imperative code example SQL HTML CSS 
Expectations of developer diverse from the reality of the program --BUG


What makes a function unpredictable?
--Sideeffects
--Inconsistent outputs(Function should have defined output)
Pure functions


React Elements Have first letter Capital and HTML elements are small casing 
Components are just Functions
